# 2018-12-16 API Spec

This is a follow up on [API deisng in 2018-12-24](2018-12-24-api.md) where survey on goa and nirvana is done.
The conclusion is instead of reinventing the wheel, we will follow OpenAPI v3.

For Spec, there is no official go package for OpenAPI v3, so we can just roll our own, I think we only need a
small subset of it since only plain JSON API without auth is needed for now.

For generation, my idea is make the generator a library so user don't rely on a global binary,
this also allow version control the generator like any other library.
When init the project, we create a `cmd/myproject-gen/main.go` and import the generator library
so user can have fine grained control over generator and we can use `reflect` instead of `go/parser` 

For UI, we can use [ReDoc](https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc), it does not support try it out like swagger UI,
but it looks much better if you are just viewing the doc.

## Spec

https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md

- media type `vnd` stands for vendor, i.e. `application/vnd.github.v3.diff`
- status code [rfc](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6) [iana](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.xhtml)
- fields are case sensitive
- use `openapi.json` or `openapi.yaml`
- `type` and `format`, i.e. type `number` have format `float`
- description is common mark

The well used petstore https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml

- `openapi` is the version of spec the doc is following

[paths](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#pathsObject) is where all the API and defined

- its a map of object, the key is url pattern like `/pets`, `/pets/{petId}`
- under [one path](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#path-item-object), you can have multiple operations using different http verb [operation object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#operation-object)
- `operationId` is unique among the doc
  - [ ] TODO: I think I can use it to generate method in client or RPC
- [parameter](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#parameterObject)
  - `name`
  - `in` can be one of `query`, `header`, `path` or `cookie`
- [requestBody](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#requestBodyObject) use [Media Type Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#media-type-object)
- [responses](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#responsesObject) use a map of integer and response object

[components](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#componentsObject) allow reuse definitions

[Schema Object](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#schemaObject)

- https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/structuring.html can be a better source

````yaml
type: object
required:
- name
properties:
  name:
    type: string
  address:
    $ref: '#/components/schemas/Address'
  age:
    type: integer
    format: int32
    minimum: 0
````

- `type`
- `format`
- `properties` struct field
- `example`, free form? ...

## Generator

## UI

Besides the read only UI, might also have a swagger UI like playground with history

Problems with Redoc

- [ ] TODO: redoc it does not show header
- [ ] TODO: redoc does not show models (components)

Use redoc as standalone html https://github.com/Rebilly/ReDoc#deployment
