# 2020-01-13 Reorg

https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/pull/55

It's has been a year since [last reboot](../../2018/2018-12/2018-12-09-reboot.md).
Last time I tried to add OpenAPI support and wrote a simple http client. Those were related to my work at PayPal.
I also played around writing Docker, Mesos and Cassandra UI. The http client is now [moved into gommon](https://github.com/dyweb/gommon/issues/114)

Docker

- [dockerclient](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/lib/dockerclient) only use types from docker, implemented exec
- [dk](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/cmd/dk) is the cli using cobra

Udash

- [Run shell on host using websocket](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/blob/archive/2020-01-13/udash/pkg/host.go#L21) [#46](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/46)
  - pty has echo, so when using xterm, the server behavior is different from using plain text box to write things one at a time
- A flex box based dashboard layout using element UI [#44](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/44)
  - [#43](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/43) flex box

GitHub example

- [example/github](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/example/github) GitHub OAuth with distributed tracing
  - it is using open tracing and uber jaeger
