# 2018-12-09 Reboot

This doc is following the style I had for [gommon/log/doc/design](https://github.com/dyweb/gommon/blob/master/log/doc/design/2018-09-05-clean-up.md)
Walk through the history when I still remember it, and the plan for incoming refactor (or rewrite)

## Background

### History

go.ice development has been stopped for a long time. 
Originally it was started in 2017 as I found none of the web/service framework handy,
and I always need to do same boilerplate code over and over, parse config for http server, create cobra command etc.
The main motivation at that time is I want to have both server and client library after I wrote server interface
and implementation. It is similar to swagger, but the single source of truth is my server code, not `swagger.yaml`.
A closet one is [goa](https://github.com/goadesign/goa) which has a 'DSL' in go (actually it's using normal go code
to build AST directly, like ginkgo), but it's just REST and I want GRPC as well.
Also I do want a Rails/Laravel like one stop solution, this is actually already done by [buffalo](https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo),
which also reminds me of all the php code I wrote for make [codeigniter](https://codeigniter.com/) more Rails.

Later when I started working on [benchhub](https://github.com/benchhub/benchhub), tracing, especially distributed tracing is also added.
[opencensus](https://github.com/census-instrumentation) were not there or just started, so I adopted opentracing and [jaeger](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger).
But I actually I never used it beyond example, the example took me a while to finish.

At last the development is fully stopped after I started working, halt along with [Ayi](https://github.com/dyweb/Ayi) and [gommon](https://github.com/dyweb/gommon).

### Goals

- write server code and generate client side code and documentation
  - this works out of box for gRPC
  - if you use swagger (now open API) you might also have it
- support tracing
  - opentracing was the only standard, now it is not and it seems opencensus is getting more attention though opentracing is under CNCF

### Current implementation

- cache (empty interface)
- cli just a small wrapper to support log level etc.
  - used by ayi (gommon is using cobra directly to avoid import cycle)
- config canonical struct for http server and db
  - also have some for tracing
- db
  - a db cobra command that can ping and run migration etc.
  - a manager interface that wraps `sql/database`
  - a work in progress migration like Laravel and Rails, a migration table, up and down task etc.
- tracing
  - just wrapper around jaeger
- transport wraps around grpc and net/http
  - provides access log in http (copy and pasted that code to several places)
  - the result application structure is pretty tedious, several server package etc.

## Proposed changes

- formalize `Dockerfile` and `Makefile` so the build and release process is same across all the projects
- revisit the design on API, generate client and server for http and gRPC
  - current http server mutex is very awkward, see `JsonHandler`
- UI
  - gommon/noodle should be used for embedding assets into binary, actually I never used it beyond the example in gommon, it only shows up in TODO...
  - I already spent quite amount of time on vue and element-UI, though I was using angular w/ antdesign in [at15/fe-template](https://github.com/at15/fe-template)
- simplify db
  - might use [sqlx](https://github.com/jmoiron/sqlx) to avoid reinvent the wheel, though I'd like to have a typed query generator like [cqlc](https://github.com/pingginp/cqlc),
though if it comes to generating, even the encode and decode can be generated as well to avoid using reflect
  - might remove sqlite support because the overhead of compile time it introduced and I want to disable cgo and use static link
- task runner
  - follow the unfinished in [benchhub/runner](https://github.com/benchhub/benchhub/tree/master/pkg/runner)
  - adhoc task like database migration
  - background task likes cron and run as long as the server lives
  - distributed task (well if you have a data store as source of truth, this is not that hard as it seems)
- clients
  - need a unified implementation for many application that has no official, or not very good official implementations
  - docker (official imports too many things, all I need are the types)
  - elasticsearch, the only official one is inside [beats](https://github.com/elastic/beats)
  - github (I am not a big fan of the google one) 
  
Example applications (poor apps to try the breaking API)

- [dyweb/Ayi](https://github.com/dyweb/ayi) I think now the only use able part is `Ayi git clone` and `Ayi web static`
- [at15/goyourcassandra](https://github.com/at15/goyourcassandra) Web admin dashboard is the touchstone of a web framework
- [dyweb/gogoci](https://github.com/dyweb/gogoci) didn't even get started, could lay some ground work (especially on UI) for reboot of benchhub
