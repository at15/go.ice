# 2020-01-13 Reorg

https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/pull/55

It's has been a year since [last reboot](../../2018/2018-12/2018-12-09-reboot.md).
Last time I tried to add OpenAPI support and wrote a simple http client. Those were related to my work at PayPal.
I also played around writing Docker, Mesos and Cassandra UI. The http client is now [moved into gommon](https://github.com/dyweb/gommon/issues/114)

Docker

- [dockerclient](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/lib/dockerclient) only use types from docker, implemented exec
- [dk](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/cmd/dk) is the cli using cobra

Udash

- [Run shell on host using websocket](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/blob/archive/2020-01-13/udash/pkg/host.go#L21) [#46](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/46)
  - pty has echo, so when using xterm, the server behavior is different from using plain text box to write things one at a time
- A flex box based dashboard layout using element UI [#44](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/44)
  - [#43](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/43) flex box

GitHub example

- [example/github](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/example/github) GitHub OAuth with distributed tracing
  - it is using open tracing and uber jaeger
  - [#4](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/4)
  - [#18](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/issues/18)
  
Tracing

- only [jaeger](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/ice/tracing) was supported

Transport

- [http and grpc](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/ice/tracing)
- a shutdown wrapper using context
- common wrapper for tls
- json handler

DB

- [adapter for DSN, place holders](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/ice/db)
- [migration](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/ice/db/migration) is not implemented, but does have some boilerplate code, creating schema for migration table itself etc.
- I think part of it was related to my oltpbench fork
- support mysql, postgres, sqlite

cli

- [version and default flags for logger](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/archive/2020-01-13/ice/cli)

config

- structs to avoid dependency cycle

api

- support for [openapi](https://github.com/dyweb/go.ice/tree/reorg/2020-01-13/api/openapi, implementation of the new design (last year)
  - I remember it's a lot of manual work to write go struct based on json schema

The new goal for go.ice is providing what is needed for benchhub, ayi(pm).

- provide a better `http.Handler` interface, e.g. error/panic handling, json encoding. Most go web frameworks already provide one.
- reduce duplicated code for initializing different services when server start, like [wire](https://github.com/google/wire) or [controller-runtime/inject](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/master/pkg/runtime/inject/inject.go)

Actually that is all I need for now ...
