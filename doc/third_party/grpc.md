> gRPC Server Reflection provides information about publicly-accessible gRPC services on a server, and assists clients at runtime to construct RPC requests and responses without precompiled service information. It is used by gRPC CLI, which can be used to introspect server protos and send/receive test RPCs.

- proto and rpc service should be defined in separated proto, so http server can also use the struct generated by protobuf without introducing dependency of grpc
