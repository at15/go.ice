# udash (Universal dashboard)

udash is a demo application for go.ice to show how to use it to write a universal dashboard,
The original github oauth example is replaced by the dashbard because latter is more useful and can run locally. 
It is based on [at15/goyourcassandra](https://github.com/at15/goyourcassandra)

The code is currently in tree because go.ice is in very early stage and keep the example in tree makes dependency management easier.
