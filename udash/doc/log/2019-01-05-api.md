# 2019-01-05 Udash API

This doc describes current design of udash, since api and httpserver package is not ready, 
we will be using `gorilla/mux` to extract parameter from route and there is no generated swagger doc

## Package layout

````text
cmd
   udash (for now just the start server command, udash serve)
   udash-gen (wait on the api package)
pkg
   static.go serving static assets locally during dev and use noodle when release
   docker.go all the docker related logic
   routes.go mount all the routes   
ui
   typical Vue UI
````

## API

all the api under `/api/` and support pretty print json if required `?pretty=true`

- `api/local/docker/images` list local docker images
  - `images/<image-name>` list info about on image (? how about all of its tags?)
- `api/local/docker/containers` list local docker containers
  - `containers/<id-or-name>` list container detail
  - `containers/<id-or-name>/logs` stream log etc.
