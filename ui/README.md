# UI

The UI in go.ice a usable dashboard example you can copy and paste to your own project.
In the future we may have a project builder to copy and paste automatically.
For now, use the clipboard, Luke.

## Start new vue project

- install vue cli `npm install -g @vue/cli`
- `vue create --no-git -m yarn ui` then choose default preset
- in `package.json` rename `ui` to your project name
- use `vue ui` to add newly created project

Adding libraries
